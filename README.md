# IntroOpenGL
Let's learn OpenGL together. Hello triangle!
This repo contains code answer keys and examples for the Learn OpenGL workshop at CuseHacks 2021

## My Philosophy when it comes to learning APIs 
Code along with, then get creative and break some stuff. Make notes on what compiler errors you are getting and start to understand what's going on behind the abstraction curtain.

## The goal of the workshop is to render a single orange triangle. Everything from there is gravy. Good luck!

### Some notes and repo details

## I've already written the Makefile 
This should make somethings easier for linux and macOS users who are familiar with the Command Line.

If you cannot attend the workshop and are still interested in learning openGL, the workshop
leans heavily on content from learnopengl.com
